(7) Additional test notes 

- You had print_entries after you freed the linked list so there was no output
   - I fixed this
   - make sure you test your programs before submitting
- All tests for part A passed after fix
- Only Part A implmented
-----

(8) Code inspection

- Why did you try to print the list after it was already freed?
- Avoid global variables
- your linked list functions should take parameters to set values 

GRADE
C+ (5)
